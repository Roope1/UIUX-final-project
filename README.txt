To run the site, navigate to the "project folder" in a terminal of your choice and run the site with the command "flutter run -d chrome".
Site has been tested and proved to work on chrome so we recommend using it for the best experience. 
Using with other web browsers might work but your mileage may vary.


If the application fails to compile, please refresh the assets and pubspec.yaml file, by running the command "flutter pub get" in the project root folder.
